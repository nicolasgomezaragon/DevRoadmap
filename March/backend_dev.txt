This is the beginning of a project that will change my entire life, however, 
this will be a long journey towards giving it shape.

I already have an idea of what I would like to build, however, there are stairs
towards that dream. 

My current job is a great starting point to forge my work ethic, for becoming a
reliable, disciplined, responsible and integer personal on my job.  I need to push 
towards that goal, and become my best professional version, as well, making Anubis the
greatest dog on Earth, cultivating my lovely relationship with Yuliana and taking care 
of my parents, use up the time. 

For this project, I need not just to work during my work, but also organize my whole 
life to be able to work at home morning time but also doing sport, cooking and eventually
start optimizing time to complete my studies, work and have a life. 

This will be certainly a challenge, but I prefer to endure this hardship than to give up.

The goal right now is simple: BEAR
Becoming stronger, more patient, more resilient and more resourceful than I have been until
this point in time. This is not for Yuliana, Anubis or my parents, I want to build a life
that is worth living and enduring is the path. Evolving.

I will become a backend developer.
Learning from the ground up programming but also software, practices and tooling. 
Doing projects and developing day after day my software skills. 
I will become great at this, not only for a job but for my company.

The plan will be the following:
+ Develop a complete CRM with Java, learning of OOP and DS/Algorithms along the way.
+ Develop a technical analysis API to pull data with Go and analyze it with Python.
+ Develop my personal website with MERN stack as a CV.

- Additionally, learn about DevOps tooling as Cloud (AWS), CI/CD, 
Contaneinerization and Monitoring and Logging.

With this, I'll be learning about everything what I'm interested about backend development. 
Although I hate this job for the motherfucker monotony, I really want to complete a whole year here.
To prove that to myself, to train consisteny and patience on my life. If I complete that, an stage 
will be completed, I will be free to go with my liquidation to pay a good amount of Ryan and start a
new stage with a better salary with my skills.

I could take maybe a shortcut, but that is not for real men, men must endure.
This boredom will make me stronger, but I need to train myself daily for it and keep building
my mindset day after day, if I get through, this will be an step forward and not another regret.

Work ethic in here, professional skills by myself, I need to work for Anubis, for Yulis, for my
parents and for my future self, for the person I want to become.

Let's do this out.
